# ml_dl
ML and DL models with base modules like numpy, tensorflow. The intent of the repo is to understand how we can build some popular models from grounds up. 


# ML -- Creating all basic ML models using base packages only like numpy, pandas, list etc.

k-means = K means algo using numpy
pca = pca using numpy
logistic regression = using numpy simple gradient descent of log loss
decision tree = binary feature based simple decision tree

# DL -- Creating popular deep learning models like DNN, RNN, LSTM , Multi-Head attention using base tensorflow packages.

layers = Base layers for model subclassed from keras.Layer
loss = loss functions
utility_layers =  Other utility layers subclassed from keras.Layer
models = models by subclassing keras.Models
